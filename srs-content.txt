3.2 Overall Description
3.2.1 Identification of Pre-Existing Work
The current hostel laundry management process operates through a manual and communication-dependent system. Students are provided laundry bags with physical cards showing total and used wash counts. To request a wash, they must send the count of clothes to laundry staff via WhatsApp, and staff later notify them to collect the clothes. This manual process often results in miscommunication, missed pickups, delays, and lack of real-time tracking of laundry bags.
To overcome these challenges, SmartWash builds upon existing, proven technologies for developing a digital and AI-driven solution. It uses React Native for mobile application development, Node.js with Express.js for backend services, MongoDB for centralized data storage, and Python-based AI modules (Flask/FastAPI with TensorFlow) for intelligent automation, chatbot interaction, and prediction models.
By combining these existing tools and frameworks, SmartWash modernizes the manual laundry process into a smart, automated, and transparent system that enhances efficiency for both students and staff.

3.2.2 Perspective on Product
SmartWash is a standalone web and mobile-based system that replaces the manual WhatsApp-based hostel laundry process. It connects students and laundry staff through a shared database, enabling real-time tracking, automated updates, and AI-powered assistance.
Students use the mobile app to request and track laundry services, while staff use the web dashboard to manage pickups, washing, and deliveries. Integrated AI modules handle chat responses, wash-time prediction, and alert notifications, ensuring an efficient and transparent laundry workflow.
